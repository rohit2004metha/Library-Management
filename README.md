# Library Management System

The Library Management System is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack project designed to facilitate the management of libraries. It provides a user-friendly interface for library users, librarians, and administrators to perform various tasks efficiently. This README file serves as a guide to set up and understand the project.

## Features

### Authentication and Authorization

- **Sign Up & Sign In**: Users can create an account and sign in to access the system.
- **Role-based Access Control**: The system supports different roles, including User, Librarian, and Admin. Each role has specific permissions and restrictions.
- **Access Tokens and Refresh Tokens**: User authentication is implemented using access and refresh tokens for secure and seamless user experience.

### User Features

- **List of Libraries**: Users can view a list of available libraries.
- **List of Books**: Users can browse books available in the libraries.
- **Borrow Books**: Users can request to borrow books from a library.
- **Return Books**: Users can return borrowed books to the respective library.
- **Review Books**: Users can provide feedback and reviews for books they have read.

### Librarian Features

- **Manage Own Library**: Librarians can oversee and manage their assigned library.
- **Manage Books in Library**: Librarians can add, update, and remove books from their library's inventory.
- **Manage Borrowed and Returned Books**: Librarians can track borrowed and returned books within their library.
- **Manage Borrow Process**: Librarians handle the borrowing process, verifying requests, and maintaining records.

### Admin Features

- **Manage Libraries**: Administrators have control over the overall library system and can manage libraries.
- **Assign Librarian**: Admins can assign librarians to specific libraries.
- **Manage Members**: Admins can manage member accounts and profiles.
- **Generate and Analyze Metrics**: Admins can access and analyze various metrics related to members and libraries.

## Technology Stack

The project utilizes the following technologies:

- Frontend:
  - Vite: A fast and efficient frontend build tool.
  - TypeScript: A statically-typed superset of JavaScript for enhanced development experience.
  - React.js: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Backend:
  - Node.js: A server-side JavaScript runtime environment.
  - Express.js: A minimalist web application framework for Node.js.
  - MongoDB: A NoSQL document database for data storage and retrieval.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the Library Management System project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/narendra-singh-chauhan/library-management-system.git

   ```

2. Install dependencies for both the frontend and backend. Navigate to the project directory and run the following commands:

   ```bash
   # Install frontend dependencies
   cd frontend
   npm install

   # Install backend dependencies
   cd ../backend
   npm install

   ```

3. Configure the environment variables:

   - For the frontend, create a .env file in the frontend directory and set the appropriate environment variables required for the frontend application.

   - For the backend, create a .env file in the backend directory and set the necessary environment variables required for the backend server.

4. Start the development servers:

   ```bash
   # Start the frontend development server
   cd frontend
   npm run dev

   # Start the backend server
   cd ../backend
   npm run dev

   ```

5. Access the Library Management System in your browser:

   - Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the application.
